Chrome is the gold standard. Google has been leading to effort to spec and implement web components.

There are three major libraries for working with and extending web components:

X-TAG
X-Tag is a small JavaScript library, created and supported by Mozilla, that brings Web Components Custom Element capabilities to all modern browsers.
http://x-tags.org/

POLYMER
Polymer is a new type of library for the web, built on top of Web Components, and designed to leverage the evolving web platform on modern browsers.
https://www.polymer-project.org

BOSONIC
Bosonic is a set of tools that enable you to build Web Components as the spec currently describes, and supporting not-so-modern browsers like IE9.

Polyfills!
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill
All three libraries(Bosonic, Polymer, X-Tag) share and collaborate upon these polyfills, but each builds on them in a unique way.
jQuery : DOM = X-Tag/Polymer/Bosonic : Web Components

The components model allows for encapsulation and interoperability of individual HTML elements.

- separation of concerns
- event-driven architectures (EDA)
